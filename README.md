# Heart Disease Prediction Model

## Overview
The Heart Disease Prediction Model is a machine learning model developed to predict the likelihood of an individual having heart disease based on demographic information, clinical measurements, and medical history. 

## Features
- Utilizes machine learning algorithms to analyze input features and predict heart disease status.
- Trained on historical data containing information about individuals with and without heart disease.
- Provides probability estimates of heart disease presence for new cases.

## Usage
1. Install the necessary dependencies by running `pip install -r requirements.txt`.
2. Run the `predict.py` script to make predictions for new cases.
3. Input demographic information, clinical measurements, and medical history to obtain heart disease likelihood.
